### License
The license we chose was [Apache License Version 2.0](https://github.com/jog141/repo-project/blob/master/LICENSE.md).

We chose this license because it was an open source license that allows the contributor to do whatever they want with the code. We wanted a license that would allow contributors to do what they want and redistrubte as they please without being liable ourselves if something goes wrong which this license protects us from. We chose the license to give the contributors freedom to do anything while also protecting the licensors from any damage.
