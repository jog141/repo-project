### Code of Conduct

We chose the Contributor Covenant because it very well articulated the way we want our program to be used. Anyone can have an opinion on music, so it's important that the content our users implement into our program isn't offensive or inappropriate for any audience. We also agreed with the consequences the Contributor Covenant has in place if there is violation these rules.
