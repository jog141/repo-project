Here's how to download repo directly:
``` 
git clone https://github.com/jog141/repo-project
cd repo-project

```
Our piece of software is under the MIT lisence / X11 lisence because we aren't very peticular about what our users do with our program, but we don't want to be held accountable for their actions.

### Usage

Description:
This program asks the user to input their name as well as their favorite artist. Then the program prints out there name and the artist as well as compliments them on their artist choice. After this is executed our program 

    'def getartist():
        name = input("What's your name?")
        artist = input("What is your favorite artist?")
        print("Wow great choice", name, ",", artist, "releases some hit songs!")

    getartist()'

After printing out the above line of code, the user will shown how many other users entered that artist and a percentage of total users who entered the same artist.

Then user will then be prompted to enter in 'yes' or 'no' if they want to see the artist's latest music video. If they said 'yes', they will be taken to the YouTube page for the video, otherwise the program will end.

This program can allow the user to stay updated on the latest music from the artist as well as see how many people also like this artist.

### License

The license we chose was [Apache License Version 2.0](https://github.com/jog141/repo-project/blob/master/LICENSE.md).

We chose this license because it was an open source license that allows the contributor to do whatever they want with the code. We wanted a license that would allow contributors to do what they want and redistrubte as they please without being liable ourselves if something goes wrong which this license protects us from. We chose the license to give the contributors freedom to do anything while also protecting the licensors from any damage.

### Code of Conduct

We chose the Contributor Covenant because it very well articulated the way we want our program to be used. Anyone can have an opinion on music, so it's important that the content our users implement into our program isn't offensive or inappropriate for any audience. We also agreed with the consequences the Contributor Covenant has in place if there is violation these rules.
